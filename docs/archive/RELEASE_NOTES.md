## OptiFabric 1.1.2+mc1.21.11 — OptiFine on Fabric 1.21.11

Run **OptiFine** and **Fabric** in the same 1.21.11 client. Drop OptiFabric and your own OptiFine jar into `mods/`; at startup OptiFabric runs OptiFine's installer, remaps its patches into Fabric's namespace, repairs the structural conflicts with Fabric API, and hands the result to Fabric Loader's class transformer.

**OptiFine is not bundled or redistributed** — bring your own `OptiFine_1.21.11_HD_U_J9.jar` (or another 1.21.11 build).

### New in 1.1.2 — anti-aliasing, on every release from 1.21.3 up

**1.1.2 covers eight jars** — 1.21.3, 1.21.4, 1.21.6, 1.21.7, 1.21.8, 1.21.9, 1.21.10 and 1.21.11 (1.21 and 1.21.1 stay at 1.1.0: OptiFine only ships the old chain location for those, which the repair never touched). On 1.21.11 this jar behaves exactly like 1.1.1, which already had this fix.

Anti-aliasing was broken on all of them. The pipeline deleted OptiFine's own `post_effect/fxaa_of_{2,4}x.json`, while that chain id (`minecraft:fxaa_of_2x`) is resolved by the **game's post-chain registry** from `post_effect/` — OptiFine patches `ShaderManager` to register it there. So every resource reload logged `Resource not found: minecraft:post_effect/fxaa_of_2x.json`, and touching anti-aliasing (or picking a shader pack — both reload the shaders) ended in `Failed to load post chain: minecraft:fxaa_of_2x` and a "failed to reload resources" prompt. 1.1.2 leaves OptiFine's files alone. On 1.21.9 and 1.21.10 there was a second, older bug behind the black screen: from 1.21.9 the game draws post-effect passes as an attribute-less fullscreen triangle (`gl_VertexID`), while OptiFine's `fxaa_of_*.vsh` still read the `Position` vertex attribute — the pipeline rewrites those two files (1.21.11's own build already ships the fixed shape, and 1.21.3–1.21.8's pipeline still has the attribute, so both are skipped).

Measured, not assumed: all eight releases were run with the shipped jar, anti-aliasing at 2x and a shader pack loaded, and the log line `Resource not found: minecraft:post_effect/fxaa_of_*` is **0** on every one of them. The offline verification below was re-run for each of the eight.

This is versioned per artifact: 1.21.3 – 1.21.11 are 1.1.2, 1.21 and 1.21.1 keep their published 1.1.0 jars, and `v1.1.0` / `v1.1.1` stay as published.

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Minecraft | 1.21.11 |
| Fabric Loader | 0.19.5 or newer |
| Java | 21+ (tested on Java 25) |
| Side | client |
| OptiFine | your own 1.21.11 build (tested: HD_U J9, build `20260205-175838`) |
| Fabric API | optional — supported, tested with 0.141.6+1.21.11 |

### Install

1. Install a 1.21.11 Fabric client (Loader 0.19.5+).
2. Put `OptiFabric-1.1.2+mc1.21.11.jar` **and** your OptiFine 1.21.11 jar into that version's `mods/` folder. Do **not** run OptiFine's installer — dropping the file in is enough.
3. Start the game with the **Fabric** profile. The first launch spends a few seconds patching and remapping (cached afterwards under `<game dir>/.optifine/<version>/`).

### What it took for 1.21.11

OptiFine's 1.21.11 build ships its class patches as xdelta diffs, and its recompiled classes no longer line up with what Fabric API injects into. Every conflict below was found through a real crash and traced down to the bytecode; the fixers are in `patcher/fixes` and the whole story is in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md):

- **Remapping needs the game on the classpath** — member mappings are recorded per declaring class, so overrides in subclasses silently kept OptiFine's names (35 unmapped methods in `class_1308` alone → 281 broken abstract contracts, 254 lost virtual overrides).
- Injection targets OptiFine's recompiler erased (inlined helpers, renamed lambdas with a different signature) — the vanilla method bodies are restored so Fabric's injections have a target again.
- A Fabric hook that reads a render context OptiFine's pass structure never fills in — the hook is moved onto code that is never called, so the game stops crashing and the block outline is still drawn.
- The same for the **moving-blocks** renderer hook, whose caller lives in *another* class — those call sites are redirected too, otherwise the hook fires from the injected copy (this one crashed multiplayer after ~30 seconds).
- Fabric's renderer registry being empty while `contains_renderer` keeps Indigo away — an inert placeholder renderer is registered, which also stops the **F3 debug screen** from crashing.
- Item models failing to bake (every item texture missing), chunk rendering NPEs from OptiFine's region constructor, obfuscated fields with mismatching descriptors, same-typed synthetic `this$0`/`val$…` fields, and `ChunkOF` object creation replacing Fabric's injection point.
- Stack map frames were being recomputed for **every** patched class (the global override fixer always reports a change, so the patcher could not tell), and the merge degraded a local to `java/lang/Object` in classes as unrelated to Fabric as `ShoulderParrotFeatureRenderer` and `EntityRenderDispatcher` — the game rejects those with `VerifyError: Bad type on operand stack in putfield`. Classes no fixer modifies now keep OptiFine's own frames, and recomputation only happens where a fixer really changed the class.

### Verified

- Offline, every class is loaded and linked in a single loader (the same way the game does it) and checked with the JVM verifier plus an ASM data-flow verifier: **570/570 patched game classes** and **874/874 OptiFine classes**, 0 failures, 0 verifier problems.
- Mixin member references, `@At` injection points, `@Shadow` members and uninitialised-field scans: clean (the only 4 `@At` misses belong to the **disabled** Indigo).
- In game: startup, title screen, singleplayer, **multiplayer server**, block/chunk/item rendering, **shaders** (`ComplementaryReimagined` loaded), F3 debug screen — 0 `[ERROR]` lines and no crash report in the final session.

### Known limits (deliberate)

- **Conflicts with Sodium** (declared); `no_fog`, `thallium`, `xradiation`, `ryoamiclights` are declared incompatible.
- **Mods that rely on FRAPI/Indigo** do not get Indigo's custom rendering — OptiFine renders the terrain. Fabric's renderer API exists but is backed by a placeholder (F3 shows `OptifineRendererPlaceholder`), and it explains itself if something really tries to draw through it.
- Two Fabric API hooks are intentionally inert: the `BEFORE_BLOCK_OUTLINE` event does not fire (the outline is still drawn), and the Fabric renderer's moving-block hook is bypassed (moving blocks are drawn by the vanilla path).
- OptiFine cannot see resources inside Fabric mods (`Unknown resource pack type: ...ModNioResourcePack`) — a limitation on OptiFine's side.
- Shader packs log warnings such as `Unknown macro value: IRIS_VERSION` or `ParseException: Model variable not found: …`; those come from the shader pack.

### Files

| File | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `OptiFabric-1.1.2+mc1.21.11.jar` (873615 bytes) | `B62AB6AEBD441E67C75F1FD239DFFF3286B437EA8B6B95AC5597AE7AC4FEFEF0` |

The same `v1.21.x` project also builds the other Minecraft releases OptiFine ships a 1.21.x build for — 1.21, 1.21.1, 1.21.3, 1.21.4, 1.21.6, 1.21.7, 1.21.8, 1.21.9 and 1.21.10 — with `.\gradlew -p v1.21.x build "-Pmc=<version>"`, and each of them passes the same offline verification (see [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md)).
