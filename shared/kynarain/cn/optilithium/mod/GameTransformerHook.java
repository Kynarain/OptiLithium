/*
 * New in the 1.20.6 port of OptiLithium (which is MPL-2.0, see LICENSE.txt). This file has no upstream
 * counterpart.
 *
 * Hooks the patched Minecraft classes into Fabric Loader's own game transformer.
 *
 * Loader patches game classes through net.fabricmc.loader.impl.game.patch.GameTransformer, whose
 * transform(String) is the FIRST thing KnotClassDelegate.getPreMixinClassByteArray consults when it
 * loads a class - before the classpath, and before Mixin runs. OptiFine's patched classes therefore
 * go straight into that transformer's patched class map:
 *
 *   - it works for any class name, with no generated stub mixins and no Mixin API coupling;
 *   - Mixin (and every other mod's mixins into those classes) still applies afterwards, because the
 *     bytes we hand over are the input to the Mixin transformer, not its output;
 *   - classes loader patched itself (the client brand retriever, the entrypoint) are left alone.
 *
 * The field is located by type rather than by name, so a rename in Loader does not break it, but the
 * shape is asserted and any mismatch is reported instead of silently doing nothing.
