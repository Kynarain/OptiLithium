/*
 * New in the 1.21.11 port of OptiLithium (which is MPL-2.0, see LICENSE.txt).
 *
 * Registers an inert rendering plug-in with Fabric's renderer API, so that Fabric API's own hooks find *something*
 * where they look instead of throwing on the lookup itself.
 *
 * fabric.mod.json declares "fabric-renderer-api-v1:contains_renderer": true (the same value Sodium declares) to
 * tell Indigo to step aside, because OptiFine is the terrain renderer here. That flag is what Fabric API reads when
 * it decides who renders: Indigo refuses to apply its mixins and never registers itself. Fabric API's renderer
 * modules, however, do not check the flag - they check the *registry*:
 *
 *   private static Renderer activeRenderer;   // net.fabricmc.fabric.impl.renderer.RendererManager
 *   if (activeRenderer == null) throw new UnsupportedOperationException(
 *       "Attempted to retrieve active rendering plug-in before one was registered.");
 *
 * Two live paths reach that: the "Renderer:" line of the F3 debug screen (an entry fabric-renderer-api-v1 registers
 * for itself), and - before StubInjectionTargetFix hid it - the moving block hook that was the multiplayer crash.
 * The first one is still there, so pressing F3 would take the game down.
 *
 * OptiLithium cannot become a real renderer (OptiFine draws; this is not an Indigo replacement), so what gets
 * registered is a placeholder that throws a sentence worth reading if anything ever does ask it to draw, and whose
 * class name is what shows up behind "Renderer:" in F3. That is the honest description of the situation: a Fabric
 * renderer exists as far as the API is concerned, and it is OptiFine doing the rendering.
 *
 * On 26.1.2 that stopped being the right answer. Fabric API moved the terrain and submit-node integration into
 * fabric-renderer-api-v1 itself, and what Indigo has left there is one item mixin and two accessors - it is not a
 * terrain renderer any more, so the key that tells it to step aside has nothing left to step aside from. All it
 * did on that line was disable a rendering plug-in Fabric API keeps asking for: FRAPI mods emitted their quads
 * into the inert placeholder, which is invisible geometry and no error at all. The 26.x line therefore does not
 * declare the key, Indigo registers its own IndigoRenderer, and this class steps out of the way - see
 * indigoWillRegister(). The 1.21.x line keeps the key, because there Indigo *is* the terrain renderer and what it
 * steps aside from is an injection point OptiFine's rewrite of the chunk build removes (fatal under
 * "defaultRequire": 1).
 *
 * Two ordering rules come with it:
 *
 *   - it runs in the preLaunch entrypoint, after OptiFine's patched classes have been handed to Fabric Loader.
 *     Registering first would win the race against any other renderer, but the classes this touches have to be
 *     resolved *through* the patched set - loading one of them around it leaves the game with the vanilla class for
 *     the rest of the run (that is exactly how the getBlockStateBaseCacheClass crash happened, see
 *     RendererApiStubGenerator);
 *   - nothing here calls a reflective method lookup that resolves the interface's other signatures. Only "register"
 *     is looked up, and its only argument type is the interface itself.
 *
 * If something else registered a renderer first, that one is left alone and this only logs a line.
