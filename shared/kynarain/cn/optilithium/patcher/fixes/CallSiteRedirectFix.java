/*
 * New in the 1.21.11 port of OptiLithium (which is MPL-2.0, see LICENSE.txt).
 *
 * Moves every call to a method onto another name, in the classes that call it.
 *
 * StubInjectionTargetFix renames the method a Fabric API hook injects into and leaves a copy behind under the
 * original name, so the hook lands in code nobody runs. That only holds while the calls to that method live in
 * the same class: LevelRenderer.method_62210 is called from inside LevelRenderer itself, so that fixer could
 * rewrite the calls it found there. The moving block hook is the other way round - the vanilla method is called
 * from a neighbour class (net/minecraft/class_11684.method_73002), which then still resolved to the copy Mixin
 * had just injected into, and the crash came straight back:
 *
 *   UnsupportedOperationException: Attempted to retrieve active rendering plug-in before one was registered.
 *     at FabricBlockModelRenderer.render -> Renderer.get()
 *     at class_11681.handler$zmb000$fabric-renderer-api-v1$beforeRenderMovingBlocks
 *     at class_11681.method_72998
 *     at class_11684.method_73002
 *
 * This fixer closes that gap from the calling side, and it is registered as an "extra class": the caller is not
 * something OptiFine patches, so it is taken over the same way the callee is (see OptifineFixer#registerExtraClass).
 * Only the invoked name changes - owner, arguments and the instruction itself stay untouched, so no local
 * variable, stack map or injection offset moves.
