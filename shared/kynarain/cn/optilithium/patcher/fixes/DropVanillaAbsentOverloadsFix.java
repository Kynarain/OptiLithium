/*
 * New in the 26.x port of OptiLithium (which is MPL-2.0, see LICENSE.txt). This file has no upstream
 * counterpart.
 *
 * Removes the collision OptiFine's recompile creates when it reduces a vanilla method to a thin wrapper and
 * moves the real body into an overload of its own.
 *
 * <p>{@code LevelRenderer.extractBlockOutline(Camera, LevelRenderState)} forwards to OptiFine's own
 * {@code extractBlockOutline(Camera, LevelRenderState, boolean)}, and
 * {@code CuboidItemModelWrapper.update(7 args)} forwards to its own {@code update(9 args)}. Restoring the
 * vanilla body then leaves two methods with the same name, and a Fabric mixin that names that method without a
 * descriptor - {@code method = "extractBlockOutline"}, {@code method = "update"} - is left with an ambiguity
 * MixinExtras cannot resolve: building the local-variable context for the handler fails with
 * {@code LVTGeneratorError: Could not locate method metadata for update generating LVT} and the whole class
 * fails to transform. That is every item model, on every frame.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two outcomes, both narrow:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>nothing in the class calls the extra overload any more - it is removed;</li>
 *   <li>something still calls it - it is renamed to {@code optilithium$<name>} and every reference inside the
 *       class is rewritten, so the call keeps working and the mixin's name becomes unambiguous again.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A rename is only sound because of what such an overload is: OptiFine's own addition, absent from the
 * vanilla class and from every interface (for {@code update} the 7-argument form is the {@code ItemModel}
 * method, and the 9-argument one appears nowhere in the game jar at all). Nothing outside can be calling it by
 * contract, and the reference scan below proves nothing inside is left behind. A method that something in
 * another patched class called would not be handled correctly, which is why the rename is logged loudly.</p>
