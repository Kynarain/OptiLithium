/**
 * The 1.21.6 and 1.21.7 OptiFine builds ask for a texture's multi-tex entry before anything has linked that
 * texture to the {@code AbstractTexture} it belongs to, and their own shader code then reads the link back and
 * finds nothing:
 *
 * <pre>
 * NullPointerException: Cannot read field "norm" because "multiTex" is null
 *   at net.optifine.shaders.ShadersTex.initDynamicTextureNS
 *   at net.minecraft.class_1043.method_71142
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The 1.21.8 build does the link first, so its {@code initDynamicTextureNS} finds the entry. Putting that link
 * back into these two builds is what this was meant to do, but a patched class may not call a method another
 * patched class has grown: the injector checks every call against the classes the game itself ships, so
 * {@code class_1043} came back as "Failed to prepare the patched class ... it will not be replaced".
 *
 * <p>So this drops the call instead, on exactly the classes that do not link. It only removes instructions - no
 * new reference, no new branch target, no frame to recompute - and it leaves every build that does link (1.21.8
 * and later) untouched. Those dynamic textures end up without their normal map entry, which is the lesser evil
 * against a crash that stops the game from starting at all.
