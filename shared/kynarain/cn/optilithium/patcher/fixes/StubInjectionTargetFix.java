/*
 * New in the 1.21.11 port of OptiLithium (which is MPL-2.0, see LICENSE.txt).
 *
 * Keeps a Fabric API hook from running on a code path it cannot survive, without disabling the drawing itself.
 *
 * Fabric API's rendering extensions assume the vanilla render flow. One of them reads the world render context it
 * prepared at the head of LevelRenderer.method_22710 and dies when that context is still empty:
 *
 *   NullPointerException: Cannot read field "field_63083" because the return value of
 *   WorldRenderContextImpl.worldState() is null
 *     at LevelRenderer.beforeDrawBlockOutline      (@Inject into method_62210, at HEAD)
 *
 * OptiFine replaces the pass structure those render states travel through (its own lambda$addMainPass$1 driven by
 * RenderPass), so the context is not filled in by the time the block outline is drawn. That is an API level
 * mismatch, not a bytecode shape we can repair, and it is fatal.
 *
 * So this fixer hides the injection target instead: the real method is renamed (and every call to it follows),
 * while a stub with the original name and descriptor is left in its place. Mixin finds its target and injects -
 * whichever require it uses - but nothing ever calls the stub, so the hook stays inert and the block outline is
 * still drawn by the renamed method. Losing that one event is the price of not crashing; the drawing itself is
 * untouched.
 *
 * The stub carries the *vanilla* body when there is one, not a copy of OptiFine's:
 *
 *   - mixins are written against the vanilla shape, and a handler can inject at an instruction inside the method
 *     ("@At(value = INVOKE, target = GameOptions.method_64858())" in fabric-rendering-v1's WorldRendererMixin on
 *     1.21.8, for instance). OptiFine's recompiled body does not have that call any more, so a copy of it would let
 *     Mixin find the method and still fail on the injection point - which fails the whole class at load;
 *   - the stub is dead code either way, so its body only has to look right, never to behave right.
